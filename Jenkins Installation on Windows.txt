Install Git:
1. Go to the Git download page (https://git-scm.com/downloads) and select the latest stable version of Git.

2. Download the Git installer for Windows and run it.

3. Follow the prompts to complete the installation process, and choose the default options for all settings.

4. Once the installation is complete, open the "Environment Variables" window by searching for "Environment Variables" in the Windows search bar.

5. Under "System Variables," edit the "Path" variable and add "C:\Program Files\Git\bin" and "C:\Program Files\Git\cmd" to the list of paths.

2. Click on the "Download" button and accept the license agreement.

3. Download and run the JDK installer, and follow the prompts to complete the installation process.

4. Once the installation is complete, open the "Environment Variables" window again and under "System Variables," click on "New" and add a new variable "JAVA_HOME" with the path to the JDK installation directory (e.g., C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_291).

5. Edit the "Path" variable and add "%JAVA_HOME%\bin" to the list of paths.



Install Maven:
1. Go to the Apache Maven download page (https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and select the latest stable version of Maven.

3. Open the "Environment Variables" window again and under "System Variables," click on "New" and add a new variable "MAVEN_HOME" with the path to the Maven installation directory (e.g., C:\Program Files\Maven\apache-maven-3.8.4).

4. Edit the "Path" variable and add "%MAVEN_HOME%\bin" to the list of paths.



Install Jenkins:
1. Go to the Jenkins download page (https://www.jenkins.io/download/) and select the latest stable version of Jenkins.
