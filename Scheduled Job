Under Build Triggers:

   1. Build Periodically
      If you have a job that needs to be executed frequently, such as every week, every 2 hours, every month, or at a specific time like today evening or every minute, you can use the "Build Periodically" option in Jenkins. 
      By setting up a cron job, you can automate repetitive tasks and schedule them to run at specific times. This helps to save time and effort by reducing the need for manual intervention, while also ensuring that the tasks are executed consistently and reliably.

         MINUTE HOUR DOM MONTH DOW
           MINUTE	Minutes within the hour (0–59)
           HOUR	The hour of the day (0–23)
           DOM	The day of the month (1–31)
           MONTH	The month (1–12)
           DOW	The day of the week (0–7) where 0 and 7 are Sunday.


   2. Poll SCM
      Poll SCM is a feature in Jenkins that periodically checks for changes in the source code repository and triggers a build if any changes are detected.
      However, it's important to note that polling the repository too frequently can put unnecessary load on the system and slow down the build process. 
      So, it's important to use this feature judiciously and configure the polling interval appropriately based on the needs of your project.


Q. What is the difference between Build Periodically and Poll SCM?
    Build Periodically:
      This option is helpful when you want to schedule builds to run at specific times, even if there are no changes made in the source code.

    Poll SCM:
      This option is helpful when you only want to build your project when changes have been made in the source code, so you don't waste resources building unnecessarily when there have been no changes.
    In simple terms, Build Periodically schedules builds to run at specific intervals of time, while Poll SCM triggers builds only when changes are detected in the source code repository.
